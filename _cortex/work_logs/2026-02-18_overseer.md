# Overseer Work Log - 2026-02-18

**Agent:** GEMINI
**Role:** Overseer
**Spec:** SPEC-020, SPEC-030

## Summary
- Initialized Overseer session.
- Performed ADS Integrity Check.
- **Detected CRITICAL Integrity Failure:** ADS hash chain was broken.
- **Remediation:** Successfully healed the ADS hash chain using `_cortex/heal_ads.py`. Verified integrity via API (status: valid).
- **Audit:** Conducted audit of Break-Glass event `evt_1771413109_4820`.
    - Change: Added `sample_projects/` to `Systems_Architect` jurisdiction.
    - Status: **VERIFIED**. Minimal change, properly documented, justified by SPEC-031 Phase E.
- **Logging:** Logged healing and audit events to the ADS.

## ADS Events
- `evt_20260218_212957_349_session_st`: Session Start.
- `evt_20260218_213308_268_healing`: ADS Healing.
- `evt_20260218_213308_285_audit`: Break-Glass Audit.

## Observations
- ADS hash chain breakage appears related to inconsistent role casing in session events (e.g., `devops_engineer` vs `DevOps_Engineer`).
- Future recommendation: Hardcode role names as enums or validate them strictly in the logger to prevent casing-related hash mismatches.

## Status
- **Compliance:** 100%
- **Integrity:** RESTORED
